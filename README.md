# Machine-Learning-in-FIFA-Ultimate-Team-22

For this machine learning project, I have chosen to work with a dataset of FIFA Ultimate Team 22 players since i have always been a huge fan of the game.

I want to create a program that can predict each player's average rating based on their individual characteristics. This type of project can be very interesting because it will allow me to apply machine learning techniques and data analysis to understand how different player characteristics impact their performance.

Additionally, the final result of the project could be useful for FIFA Ultimate Team users who want to make informed decisions about which players to include in their teams.

At the very end of this notebook there is a complete predictor, where inputting the individual stats will give you the predicted overall, the actual overall and the name of the player, making use of pandasql, another cool library that i had the oportunity to try here for the first time.
